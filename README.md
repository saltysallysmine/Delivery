# Delivery

**This is educational project for MIPT Java course.**

Execute tests if you want to see what it can do. Users send POST-requests from different cities, **MainController** catches them and redirect to right RabbitMQ queues.

I am keeping ahead of forward compatibility, this is why I created the **City class** to which new cities can easily be added.
